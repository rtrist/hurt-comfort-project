johnlock, ficlet, were!john, hurt/comfort, patternofdefiance, reply, soo ummm, i'm gonna barf more backstory here because i kinda like this?, obviously an AU, where shifters are known to exist but it's basically treated like a mental illness, and john is bitten on a case and sherlock is all, ok there is actually nothing wrong with mental illness, so if that's what this is we can handle it, and also maybe it's different?, and he decides he's gonna study john during his shift, the thing is that it's actually really unclear when the shifting will present itself, so john keeps having symptoms but no actual event, and sherlock is investigating and collecting data, and kinda starts to think that john's not going to shift after all, but then the shift comes very suddenly, and is really intense and basically sherlock is NOT PREPARED, and he tries all the things he's thinking will work, and he tries things that the medical contemporaries suggest, and in this AU shifts last from 3-5 days minimum but could just...keep going, it's day 5 and john is still in were!form, and people are pressuring sherlock to hospitalize john because what if he hurts himself, or you, or whoever, and sherlock runs and takes john with him, and tries the last possible thing he thinks might work
