I haven't seen it yet but ooh
my expectations have been raised
I have a feeling I am going to be sorely disappointed
pretty sure you've oversold it based on what I've heard in general
but srsly
ninety percent of the time people are triggered by Glee I end up loving the scene
and finding it rich and emotionally satisfying
p.s. I am listening to Promiscuous Girl right now and these lyrics seemed apt

I make a halfway decent john if I do say so myself
ahhh Iw ould give anything to find this person again and continue where we left off
please tell me you didn't leave because of what I said
it was meant to be in character
because john's always like 'what do you need me for' and sherlock's like 'it was convenient'
but the subtext says 'i like u ok now shuddup'
