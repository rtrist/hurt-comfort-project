      "Violence: 15/108 * 100 = 13.89%\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: The tags without an assigned category or not falling into any category are excluded from the calculation.\n",

      "1. Create a dictionary with the categories as keys and initialize their counts to 0.\n",
      "2. Loop through each tag in the given list.\n",
      "3. For each tag, check if it falls into any of the categories.\n",
      "4. If the tag matches a category, increment the count for that category in the dictionary.\n",
      "5. After looping through all the tags, calculate the total count of categorized tags.\n",
      "6. Calculate the percentage for each category by dividing its count by the total count and multiplying by 100.\n",
      "7. Print the percentage of each category.\n",

      "To categorize the tags and calculate the percentage for each category, we can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Define the categories: Family/Friendship, Mental Health Issues, Romance, Sex, Violence, and Other.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Iterate through each tag and assign it to a category based on its content. If a tag doesn't match any category, exclude it from the analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Count the number of tags in each category and calculate its percentage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "Family/Friendship: Tag, Friendship, Bromance, Friends to lovers, Family, Mates, Parent/Child - 13 tags\n",
      "Mental Health Issues: Hurt/Comfort, PTSD, Anxiety, Abuse, Depression, Suicidal thoughts, Self-harm - 10 tags\n",
      "Romance: Romance, Get together, Slow burn, Established relationship, Fluff, Love, Pining - 12 tags\n",
      "Sex: Rated R, Rated X, Smut, NC17 - 4 tags\n",
      "Violence: Tw: past abuse, Tw: abuse, Tw: attempted rape, Tw: violence - 4 tags\n",
      "Other: Flashfiction365, Prompt, Drama, Fic rec, Canon divergent, Fanfiction, AU, Angst, Angsty, General, One shot, WIP, Under 5k wordcount, Masterpost, Meta Thoughts, Crossover, Side berica, kink - 17 tags\n",
      "\n",
      "Total categorized tags: 60\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, calculate the percentage for each category:\n",
      "\n",
      "Family/Friendship: (13 / 60) * 100 = 21.67%\n",
      "Mental Health Issues: (10 / 60) * 100 = 16.67%\n",

      "- Other: 28.33%\n",
      "To categorize the tags, we will go through each one and assign it to the appropriate category.

      "   tag_list = tags.split(\", \")\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Iterate over each tag in the `tag_list` and categorize it based on the provided categories:\n",
      "   - If the tag contains any of the following keywords, increment the corresponding category count:\n",
      "     - For Family/Friendship: 'Friendship', 'Family', 'Bromance'\n",

      "           count_other += 1\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Calculate the total count of categorized tags:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   total_count = count_family_friendship + count_mental_health + count_romance + count_sex + count_violence + count_other\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Calculate the percentage of each category based on the total count:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   percentage_family_friendship = (count_family_friendship / total_count) * 100\n",
      "   percentage_mental_health = (count_mental_health / total_count) * 100\n",

      "   percentage_other = (count_other / total_count) * 100\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Finally, print out the percentages for each category:\n",
