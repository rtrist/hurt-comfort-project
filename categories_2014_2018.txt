Now let's calculate the percentage of each category:

Family/Friendship: 26 tags
Mental Health Issues: 25 tags
Romance: 30 tags

Now, let's calculate the percentage for each category:

Family/Friendship: 17/108 * 100 = 15.74%
Mental Health Issues: 29/108 * 100 = 26.85%
Romance: 44/108 * 100 = 40.74%
Sex: 11/108 * 100 = 10.19%
Violence: 15/108 * 100 = 13.89%

Note: The tags without an assigned category or not falling into any category are excluded from the calculation.

Therefore, the percentages of each category are as follows:
- Family/Friendship: 15.74%
- Mental Health Issues: 26.85%
- Romance: 40.74%
- Sex: 10.19%
- Violence: 13.89%
To categorize the tags and calculate the percentages, we will follow these steps:

1. Create a dictionary with the categories as keys and initialize their counts to 0.
2. Loop through each tag in the given list.
3. For each tag, check if it falls into any of the categories.
4. If the tag matches a category, increment the count for that category in the dictionary.
5. After looping through all the tags, calculate the total count of categorized tags.
6. Calculate the percentage for each category by dividing its count by the total count and multiplying by 100.
7. Print the percentage of each category.

Now we can calculate the percentage of each category by dividing the number of tags in each category by the total number of categorized tags and multiplying by 100.

Family/Friendship: 15 / 89 * 100 = 16.85%
Mental Health Issues: 14 / 89 * 100 = 15.73%
Romance: 17 / 89 * 100 = 19.10%
Sex: 6 / 89 * 100 = 6.74%
Violence: 5 / 89 * 100 = 5.62%
Other: 32 / 89 * 100 = 35.96%

Therefore, the percentage breakdown of the tags is as follows:

Family/Friendship: 9 tags
Mental Health Issues: 15 tags
Romance: 30 tags
Sex: 12 tags
Violence: 10 tags
Other: 79 tags

Total categorized tags: 155 tags

Percentage of each category:

Mental Health Issues: (15/155) * 100 = 9.68%
Romance: (30/155) * 100 = 19.35%

- Mental Health Issues: 9.68%
- Romance: 19.35%
- Sex: 7.74%

To calculate the percentage of each category, we count the number of tags in each category and divide by the total number of categorized tags. We exclude the "Other" category because it does not fall under the specified categories.

Total categorized tags: 139
Total tags in the "Other" category: 15

Family/Friendship: 14 tags (10.07%)
Mental Health Issues: 26 tags (18.71%)
Romance: 24 tags (17.27%)
Sex: 5 tags (3.60%)
Violence: 20 tags (14.39%)

Please note that these percentages are rounded to two decimal places.
To categorize the given tags, we can follow these steps:

1. Create variables to keep track of the category counts:
   - family_friendship_count = 0
   - mental_health_issues_count = 0
   - romance_count = 0
   - sex_count = 0
   - violence_count = 0
   - other_count = 0

2. Loop through each tag and check which category it belongs to:
   - If the tag contains any of the following keywords: family, friendship, bromance, fic rec, brotp, OFC, OMC, MMC, FFC, grandparents, brothers, sisters, parents, children, kids, cousins, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, grandma, grandpa, mother, father, daughter, son, then categorize it as Family/Friendship and increment family_friendship_count by 1.
   - If the tag contains any of the following keywords: mental health, ptsd, depression, anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia, self-harm, suicide, therapy, counseling, then categorize it as Mental Health Issues and increment mental_health_issues_count by 1.
   - If the tag contains any of the following keywords: romance, love, romantic, couples, pairing, relationship, dating, then categorize it as Romance and increment romance_count by 1.
   - If the tag contains any of the following keywords: sex, smut, explicit, nsfw, rated R, rated X, then categorize it as Sex and increment sex_count by 1.
   - If the tag contains any of the following keywords: violence, abuse, hurt, harm, attack, injury, death, murder, then categorize it as Violence and increment violence_count by 1.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, categorize it as Other and increment other_count by 1.

3. Calculate the total count by summing up all the category counts: total_count = family_friendship_count + mental_health_issues_count + romance_count + sex_count + violence_count + other_count

4. Calculate the percentage of each category:
   - family_friendship_percentage = (family_friendship_count / total_count) * 100
   - mental_health_issues_percentage = (mental_health_issues_count / total_count) * 100
   - romance_percentage = (romance_count / total_count) * 100
   - sex_percentage = (sex_count / total_count) * 100
   - violence_percentage = (violence_count / total_count) * 100
   - other_percentage = (other_count / total_count) * 100

5. Print the calculated percentages:

```python
print("Family/Friendship: {:.2f}%".format(family_friendship_percentage))
print("Mental Health Issues: {:.2f}%".format(mental_health_issues_percentage))
print("Romance: {:.2f}%".format(romance_percentage))
print("Sex: {:.2f}%".format(sex_percentage))
print("Violence: {:.2f}%".format(violence_percentage))
print("Other: {:.2f}%".format(other_percentage))
```

Note: In the calculation, the tags are treated as case-insensitive, meaning uppercase or lowercase letters won't affect the categorization.
To categorize the tags and calculate the percentage of each category, we will go through each tag and assign it to the respective category. Here are the results:

Family/Friendship: Tag, Friendship, Bromance, Hurt/Comfort, Understanding, Hurt/Comfort, Friendship, Family, Sheriff Stilinski, SPN Fanfic, Ot5 Liam Centric, Liam Centric, Family, Family, Fun Space, Percy Jackson

Now, let's calculate the percentage of each category:

Family/Friendship: (14 tags out of 126) * 100 = 11.11%

Mental Health Issues: (20 tags out of 126) * 100 = 15.87%

Romance: (38 tags out of 126) * 100 = 30.16%

Sex: (11 tags out of 126) * 100 = 8.73%

Violence: (6 tags out of 126) * 100 = 4.76%

Other: (37 tags out of 126) * 100 = 29.37%

Please note that the percentages may not add up to exactly 100% due to rounding.
To categorize the tags and calculate the percentages, we can create a dictionary to store the count of each category. Then we iterate over the given tags, check if they match any category, and increment the respective count in the dictionary. Finally, we calculate the percentage for each category and print the results. Here's the code to accomplish this:

```python
import re

# Initialize counts for each category
categories = {
    'Family/Friendship': 0,
    'Mental Health Issues': 0,
    'Romance': 0,
    'Sex': 0,
    'Violence': 0,
    'Other': 0
}

# Define regular expressions to match each category
category_patterns = {
    'Family/Friendship': r'((friend[s]?ship)|(family))',
    'Mental Health Issues': r'((mental health)|(depression)|((post-)?traumatic stress disorder)|ptsd|anxiety|(self\s?harm))',
    'Romance': r'((romance)|(love)|(slash)|(shipping))',
    'Sex': r'((sex)|(smut))',
    'Violence': r'((violence)|(rape)|((attempted\s?)?murder)|(kidnapping))'
}

total_tags = 0

# Iterate over the tags
for tag in tags:
    # Ignore duplicate tags
    if tag in category_patterns:
        continue

    total_tags += 1
    # Check if tag matches any category
    for category, pattern in category_patterns.items():
        if re.search(pattern, tag, re.IGNORECASE):
            categories[category] += 1
            break

# Calculate and print percentages for each category
for category, count in categories.items():
    percentage = (count / total_tags) * 100
    print(f"{category}: {percentage:.2f}%")
```

Note: This assumes that `tags` is a list containing all the tags you provided in your question. The regular expressions in `category_patterns` are case-insensitive and will match various forms of each category.
To classify each tag into the appropriate category, we will analyze the words and themes present in the tags. Based on the information provided, here is the categorization of each tag:

Family/Friendship: Friendship, Bromance, Hurt/Comfort, Friendship, Someone needs hugs, Babbling!Stiles, Sheriff Stilinski, Friends to lovers, Tony needs a hug, KonohaEleven, Liam centric, OMC, OFC, Bodyguards, Family, Sweet, Death, Character death, Illness, Sickness.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of each category in the given tags:

Family/Friendship: 17 tags
Mental Health Issues: 10 tags
Romance: 15 tags
Sex: 4 tags
Violence: 9 tags
Other: 68 tags (excludes untagged tags)

Total tags: 123 (including untagged tags)

Percentage of each category:

- Romance: (15/123) * 100 ≈ 12.2%

- Violence: (9/123) * 100 ≈ 7.3%
- Other: (68/123) * 100 ≈ 55.3%

Note: The "Other" category has the highest percentage because it includes various tags that do not fall into the specific categories mentioned.

To calculate the percentage of each category, I will first count the number of tags in each category, and then calculate the percentage based on the total number of categorized tags. If there are any uncategorized tags, they will be excluded from the calculation. Let's proceed with the calculations:

Family/Friendship: 13 tags
Mental Health Issues: 9 tags
Romance: 22 tags
Sex: 12 tags
Violence: 10 tags

Total categorized tags: 66 tags

Percentage calculation:
Family/Friendship: (13 / 66) * 100 = 19.70%
Mental Health Issues: (9 / 66) * 100 = 13.64%
Romance: (22 / 66) * 100 = 33.33%
Sex: (12 / 66) * 100 = 18.18%
Violence: (10 / 66) * 100 = 15.15%

Therefore, the percentage of each category present in the provided tags is as follows:
Family/Friendship: 19.70%
Mental Health Issues: 13.64%
Romance: 33.33%
Sex: 18.18%
Violence: 15.15%

Total tags: 130

Percentage of each category:

- Mental Health Issues: (7/130) * 100 = 5.38%
- Romance: (13/130) * 100 = 10%
- Sex: (3/130) * 100 = 2.31%
- Violence: (16/130) * 100 = 12.31%
- Other: (76/130) * 100 = 58.46%

Please note that these percentages are approximate as the tags were manually categorized and may be subjective.
To categorize each tag, we will analyze the text and assign it to one of the following categories: Family/Friendship, Mental Health Issues, Romance, Sex, Violence, or Other.

Count of tags: 
Family/Friendship: 16 
Mental Health Issues: 12

Percentage of Violence: (10/105) x 100 = 9.52% 
Percentage of Other: (40/105) x 100 = 38.10%

To calculate the percentage, we divide each count by the total number of tags (14 + 19 + 18 + 10 + 12 + 32 = 105):
